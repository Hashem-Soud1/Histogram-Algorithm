To ensure the correctness of the employed logic, the results for the first small input sizes were traced manually
 to ensure the correctness of the logic for both implementations of the sequential and parallel code. 

Then the output of the sequential implementation was utilized as ground truth to compare with in order to measure 
the accuracy of the parallel implementations

Also, a function was invoked to verify that the total count of values in the final histogram data was the
same as the total count of input elements.
